# Weather App

A simple web application that uses AccuWeather API.

## Run locally

Clone this repository.

```text
git clone https://github.com/cs280fa21/weather-app
```

Open the `script.js` file and replace the `API_KEY` with your AccuWeather API Key. Next, you must create a developer account and register your app at [https://developer.accuweather.com/](https://developer.accuweather.com/).

```js
const API_KEY = "USE_YOUR_API_KEY"; // terrible practice!
// You should never save API key directly in source code
```

Finally, open the `index.html` in your favorite browser!
